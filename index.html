<h1>About Kate Hoffman Mikkelson</h1>
<p>Hello! Kate has lived in or near the Twin Cities her whole life. 
    Passionately devoted to promoting the Midwest as being more than just "flyover country," she currently volunteers 
    with the US Bartenders Guild planning networking, educational, and fundraising events.</p>
<p>When she's not bossing around bartenders, working her dayjob, or in Data Bootcamp, she can be found on her patio with 
    her cat, husband, and two step-kids. She's probably planning a trip someplace.</p>
